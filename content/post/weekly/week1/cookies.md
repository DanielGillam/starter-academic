Often, while surfing the internet or visiting a website online, you get those intrusive popup messages asking if you would like to enable cookies for your browsing session. Most times you click the accept button without knowing what cookies are or what they do in your browser. Cookies are also known as browser cookies, HTTP cookies, web cookies and internet cookies.
                                                                                                                        **What are cookies**
                                      
                                      
Cookies are small pieces of data that a web server sends back to your browser when you try to visit a website. Cookies are created by web servers in order to keep track of your identity, your movement around the website, what pages you visit and what buttons you click.  
A web server is primarily stateless. that is, it has no memory and it does not retain information about every single request and response it gets. Without cookies, there will be no way for the server to know if you are logged in after clicking a link to a new page or if you are authorized to access certain pages. 
Once logged in and you try to access another page on the website, your browser sends the cookie recieved initially, back as part of the new request. The server then reads the cookie value and uses this data to identify you. This way the server can keep track of what pages you visit and what actions you take on the website. 
This mechanism is what is used to keep track of all the different items you add to your cart when you shop online.
Cookies usually do not contain a lot of data. Information included in a cookie are primarily the url of the website that created the cookie, the duration of the cookie's lifespan and and a small string of encoded data.
                                                                                                                        **Type of Cookies**
